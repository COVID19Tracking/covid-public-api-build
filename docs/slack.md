# Slack API

The volunteer information is pulled from Slack using the Slack API. There are two apps assigned to Slack for this project:

- [Public volunteer page](https://api.slack.com/apps/A013LB85KFB) - Used by the production Github Actions to build the API
- [Public API build test](https://api.slack.com/apps/A014CQPM1QB) - Used for CircleCI to do build tests
